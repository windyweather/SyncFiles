# SyncFiles

SyncFiles is a program that finds and copies changed and new files between two directories. The program holds pairs of directories, First Path and Second Path, and then allows searching for new and changed files between the two directories. Removed files are ignored so that if, for example, files are deleted from the First Path, they remain in the Second Path.

The program is useful for a variety of functions including backing up files up over the network to a network server, or moving newly created programs from the coding target directory to a directory to run them.

The idea for the program was created a very long time ago and this is at least the third implementation in various languages and graphical frameworks.

More details later.
